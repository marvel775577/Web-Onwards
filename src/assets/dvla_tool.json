Alternatively, you can ask your GP to refer you if you have concerns about your driving abilities. If you are referred by an NHS GP or consultant, the cost is covered by the NHS.<\/p>\r\n<p>The assessment takes place at the Scottish Driving Assessment Service (SDAS) in Edinburgh. You might have to make your own arrangements to & from the centre. You should also take someone with you in case you need to be driven home. If you have been referred by an NHS doctor outside the Lothian area, you can seek reimbursement of travel expenses via your Health Board. Each individual Health Board can decide how they want to deal with this.<p>\r\n<p>The assessment usually takes about two hours. Unlike a driving test, it is an overall assessment of the impact dementia is having on your driving. It assesses whether you are able to safely and comfortably drive. It is carried out by a specialist occupational therapist and an advanced driving instructor. About 70% of all the people SDAS assess can go on driving. Talk to us via webchat or call our free helpline if you would like support in being told to stop driving.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can expect the assessment to include:<\/p>\r\n<ol type=\"1\">\r\n<li>An interview which covers the licence holder\u2019s medical and driving history, and goes through any current driving problems. There is then a short pen and paper mental ability test.<\/li>\r\n<li>Reaction time and limb strength (steering, braking) will be tested on a static \u2018rig\u2019. The rig is the set-up of a car with a steering wheel and foot pedals linked to a computer. Eyesight is also checked and by this stage, a few people will be found not safe to drive.<\/li>\r\n<li>The main part of the assessment is an on-road session in a dual-control car. The car will have brakes on both the passenger and driver sides. The assessment is a drive on local roads following a pre-set route. The advanced driving instructor acts as passenger and the occupational therapist acts as in in-car observer.<\/li>\r\n<li>At the centre at the end of the assessment, staff will tell you what they have found. The Scottish Driving Assessment Service will report back to the DVLA or the doctor who referred you and will put any recommendations in writing to you.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>If you are found safe to drive, they will suggest strategies and adaptations to minimise risk and allow you to drive with greater safety and confidence. If the DVLA decide you are safe to drive, they may renew your licence on a short term basis, most often valid for one year.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you are found not safe to drive, staff will explain why and give advice about alternatives. If this is the case, it is with immediate affect and you will be unable to drive yourself home.<\/p>"
